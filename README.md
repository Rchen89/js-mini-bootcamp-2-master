# Hack Reactor: JavaScript Mini Bootcamp II

Welcome to part two (of two) of Hack Reactor's JavaScript Mini Bootcamp. In today's session we'll be covering the following topics:

- Part I: While
- Part II: Arrays
- Part III: Array Iteration
- Part IV: Objects
- Part V: Higher-Order Functions

Each section consists of a lecture followed by a set of self-guided exercises. The self-guided exercises can be found in each section's respective folder in this repository. Before getting started, make sure that you have a JavaScript console open (like <a href="http://www.repl.it/languages/javascript" target="_blank">repl.it</a>), so you can complete all of the exercises.
